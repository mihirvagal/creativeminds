        <p>
            I was an Art enthusiasts since my school days. My Grandfather was an Artist and I
            used to observe him regularly, this encouraged me and developed interest in Drawing.
            I appeared for Intermediate Drawing Exam without any class and secured A grade during
            my college days. Though I was a Commerce Graduate, my Passion for Art always inspired
            me to make some beautiful Oil Paintings. As shown below, in the year 1995.<br>
            <br><img width="270" height="300" src="./images/picture1.png" alt="Picture #01" class="roundCorners"><br>
            <br>I got married in 1995 and got engrossed in becoming a perfect homemaker as
            every woman does. But I always made the best use of my Art, in my kids Projects,
            while teaching them diagrams and wherever possible. My elder daughter Nirmiti appeared
            for Elementary & Intermediate Drawing Grade Exam, under my Guidance and secured 'A' Grade
            in both the exams, it was there my confidence was built-up. After 3 year in 2014 my younger son
            Advait was going to appear for Elementary Drawing Exam and 2 of his friends
            came to learn Drawing, and <b> ALL </b> 3 of them secured 'A' Grade in Intermediate Drawing Exam.
            <br><br> This was the start of my Drawing Carrier and "CREATIVE MIND".
            My passion for Art always kept me upgraded. Mural, Canvas Painting, Oil painting are
            some of the techniques I learned on my own.
            I want my students of CREATIVE MIND to excel in their knowledge of Art, and apply it
            in different fields.
            Art gives stability, increases imagination, makes you feel stress free, and gives satisfaction
            of enjoying our own creativity.
            <br>Below are some of My Art Works:
